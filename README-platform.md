# Stateful for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [![Tests](https://github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Stateful provides a powerful set of tools for creating, running, discovering, storing, and sharing DevOps Notebooks. These Notebooks offer a new way of codifying engineering processes by integrating code/commands, configurations, secrets, and cloud-native tools/services. The platform enables secure collaboration using these Notebooks and their metadata to build a knowledge-base focused on streamlining DevOps.

## Overview

Stateful combines the power of interactive DevOps Notebooks with a robust set of features designed to streamline your development and operational processes. There are two major pieces:

- **Stateful Extension**: A super set of the open-source Runme project, offering enhanced features for authentication, collaboration, and security, making it ideal for teams and enterprises.
- **Stateful Cloud**: A SaaS solution that integrates with GitHub and Slack, serving as a collaboration hub for finding, launching, running, sharing, and troubleshooting Notebooks and their metadata.

- **Knowledge-Base for DevOps**: Search across Git repositories to find the necessary DevOps Notebook, explore historical sessions, commands, diffs, conversations, and metadata to accelerate investigations.
- **Team Collaboration**: Set up groups and permissions to share DevOps Notebook sessions and metadata with other engineers. Participate in discussion threads and escalate issues to Slack.
- **Visibility and Observability**: Analyze the health and structure of your DevOps processes with secure activity logs, and integrate with observability tools for flexible data use.
- **Enterprise-Ready Security**: Integrated with IAM tools like Okta, Active Directory, and Google Workspace for frictionless access provisioning and secure data storage with end-to-end encryption.


### Features

- **Runnable Engineering Docs**: Launch Markdown files from GitHub as runnable DevOps Notebooks, saving sessions to the Stateful cloud.
- **Easy Discovery**: Quickly locate and launch DevOps Notebooks from your GitHub organization with one click to open in VS Code, clone the repo, and start running.
- **History and Metadata**: Automatically save commands, metadata, outputs, and history to Stateful. Search your history, see diffs, share, and troubleshoot processes.
- **Slack Integration**: Easily escalate or share DevOps Notebooks and commands on Slack for team troubleshooting and discussion.
- **Backstage Plugin**: View activity feeds, search, and launch project docs directly into runnable DevOps Notebooks with the Stateful plugin for Backstage.
- **Activity Overview**: Get a quick overview of team DevOps activities and request details for outage investigations with one click.
- **Robust Team Management**: Streamlined user and group management with permissions for sensitive workflows to avoid costly accidents, integrated with key enterprise tools like SIEM.
