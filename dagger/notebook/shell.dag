# Dagger notebook `shell.dag`

Build notebook piplines using the brand new ðŸ”¥ dagger shell. New files with the `.dag` extension will default run via `dagger shell`.

## Let's go

We need some upstream artifacts. First, compile the Runme kernel binary.

```sh {"id":"01JMMSSHXM7N70W4KCHTX92MHE","name":"KERNEL_BINARY"}
### Exported in runme.dev as KERNEL_BINARY
github.com/purpleclay/daggerverse/golang $(git https://github.com/stateful/runme | tag v3.12.2 | tree) |
  build |
  file runme
```

Then, grab the presetup.sh script to provision the build container.

```sh {"id":"01JMMSSHXM7N70W4KCHY04QVSE","name":"PRESETUP","terminalRows":"14"}
### Exported in runme.dev as PRESETUP
git https://github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme |
  head |
  tree |
  file dagger/scripts/presetup.sh
```

## Build the Runme VS Code EXTENSION

Let's tie together above's artifacts via their respective cell names to build the Runme VS Code extension.

```sh {"id":"01JMMSSHXM7N70W4KCJ1N0DVXG","name":"EXTENSION","terminalRows":"26"}
### Exported in runme.dev as EXTENSION
github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme |
  with-remote github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme main |
  with-container $(KERNEL_BINARY) $(PRESETUP) |
  build-extension GITHUB_TOKEN
```
