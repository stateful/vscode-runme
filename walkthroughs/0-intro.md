Runme extension enables you to create and manage interactive runbooks within your code editor. With this extension, you can perform various runbook operations, including editing, saving output, creating and updating documents, choosing custom interpreters and supported languages, debugging, and more—all within your VSCode.

## **How Runme process your markdown**

When you install the Runme VSCode extension, every markdown file opened with the runbook extension in your code editor will be displayed as a runbook (confirm if this term is accurate). This means your markdown file automatically turns into an interactive runbook where you can easily add code snippets, markdown documents, and access other amazing features of Runme.

## **Set Runme Notebook as Default Markdown Viewer**

Configure your code editor to make Runme Notebook as your default markdown viewer. Once set, Runme Notebook will automatically open whenever you open a markdown file.

Follow these simple steps to set Runme Notebook as your default viewer:

- Right click your`.md` file to open a context menu.
- From the list of options, select “**Open with...”.** This will open a submenu with additional choices.

- Lastly, select “Runme Notebooks for DevOps” as your default markdown viewer.

With these simple steps, you would not have to manually choose Runme Notebook every time you want to view a markdown file; it becomes the automatic and permanent default markdown view.
