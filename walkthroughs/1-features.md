Here is a glimpse of the key features available in the [VSCode extension](https://docs.runme.dev/features) .

## Create and Run Interactive Runbooks

By simply creating a markdown file(md), you will be provided with a runbook environment where you can add and run your code and markdown documents.

## Run a command

To run a command, simply click the run button (may require your mouse over the command in some themes). You will notice that this turns into a stop button for hung or long-running commands, which can be used to kill the terminal process.

![npm-install](https://github.com/runmedev/vscode-runme/assets/36479528/b7a950dc-9ec4-4b45-b1c7-06facd860f15)

A succeeding exit code will be indicated with the small green checkbox seen below:

You can also open the terminal that did the execution by clicking the “Open Terminal” button as shown above with its PID.

## Save outputs

Configure the autosave feature to automatically save your outputs, ensuring you never lose valuable information. You can turn off/on the autosave at anytime you desire.

## Copy & paste

Outside of literally running commands, Runme offers the ability to quickly copy commands (with the click of a button) out of a markdown file to paste into your terminal.

## Wide Range of Supported Languages

Runme supports a wide range of programming languages, including PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. Select the language of your choice from the list

## Configure your Cell

There are a wide range of configuration options. This gives you the flexibility to define how your markdown file should run either by [cell](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/cell-level) or the [entire document](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/document-level). There are further advanced configurations, such as chain cell outputs, `terminalrow` `excludeFromRunAll`, `mimeType` and more, for additional customization options.
